\title{Calculate the ROGUE value of each putative cluster for each sample.}
\usage{
rogue(expr, labels, samples, platform = NULL, k= NULL, min.cell.n = 10, remove.outlier.n = 2, span = 0.5, r = 1, mt.method = c("fdr","BH"))
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{The expression matrix. Rows should be genes and columns should be cells.}

\item{labels}{A vector of cell cluster lables for all cells corresponding to 'expr' argument.}

\item{samples}{A vector of samples (e.g. patients) to which each cell belongs, corresponding to 'expr' argument.}

\item{min.cell.n}{Only clusters containing at least this many cells will receive ROGUE values.}

\item{remove.outlier.n}{Remove this many outlier cells when calculating ROGUE.}

\item{span}{The parameter Î± which controls the degree of smoothing.}

\item{r}{A small fixed value to avoid log(0) of mean gene expression levels. The default value of r is set to 1, but can also be set to other values such as 0.1 and 0.01.}

\item{filter}{Logical, whether to filter out low-abundance genes and low-quality cells.}

\item{min.cells}{if parameter filter is "TRUE", include genes detected in at least this many cells.}

\item{min.genes}{if parameter filter is "TRUE", Include cells where at least this many genes are detected.}

\item{mt.method}{The multiple testing method used in p.adjust.}
}
\value{
A dataframe where rows represent samples, cols represent clusters, and values represent corresponding ROGUEs.
}
\description{
